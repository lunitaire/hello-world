This is a list of tools and programs I enjoy using in my workflow.

- Hyper.is for terminal (monokai theme) paired with oh-my-zsh (spaceship theme) + fira code font (w/ ligatures)
- Postman for testing APIs
- Quiver for note taking
- Todoist for keeping track of everything
- iPad Pro with Apple Pencil for drawing and design work
