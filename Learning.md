# Learning
An incomplete list of learning resources that I've found helpful.

### Online Learning Platforms
* [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/atrianwagner)  
   I've spent the past couple years soaking up as much as possible, completed multiple Tracks, and earned a ridiculous number of badges. According to their leaderboards I have "more total points than 99% of all other students."
* [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io)
* [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com)  
   * I wish there was a way to link all my certificates from one page. Right now the easiest way to see them all are on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atrianwagner).
* [Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/lunitaire)  
   Recommended by some friends in WeAllJS.
* [CheckiO](https://checkio.org/user/lunitaire)  
   This is a Python specific coding game, which is a lot of fun.
