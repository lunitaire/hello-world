# Learning
Currently trying to compile a list of all the learning resources that I've found helpful.

#### Book Queue: Profession related books that are currently in my reading queue
* The Phoenix Project, written by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford  
   Currently at 78%. I am really enjoying it so far.
* The Effective Enginner, written by Edmond Lau  
   Recently started. This had great reviews on Amazon.
* Site Reliabiliity Engineering, edited by Beyer, Jones, Petoff, and Murphy  
   Recommended by a coworker. This definitely looks interesting.
* Code, written by Charles Petzold  
   Looks like it has lots of fun diagrams.

#### Written Coding Resources: Books I am currently using as references
* Effective Python, written by Brett Slatkin
* Python Cookbook 3rd Edition, written by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones
* Fluent Python, written by Luciano Ramlho
* PHP Cookbook 3rd Edition, written by David Sklar and Adam Trachtenberg
* The entire Packt Publishing library  
   Currently using a yearly subscription to have access to everything.

### Online Learning Platforms
#### 
* Treehouse  
   I've spent the past year soaking up as much as possible, completed multiple Tracks, and earned a ridiculous number of badges. According to their leaderboards I have "more total points than 99% of all other students." 
* Lynda  
   So many topics, not enough time!
