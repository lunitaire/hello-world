# hello-world

My online alias is lunitaire. My analog handle is Atrian. 

I have been going by lunitaire since the days of Geocities, but lately others have started using this username across the web. To differentiate myself I have started rebranding myself across the web as **Atrian \\\\lunitaire**. 

I have many talents and interests thanks to my love of learning and sense of curiosity. I have pivoted across many roles throughout the tech and design industries. I thoroughly enjoy designing and developing new projects and finding innovative ways to support and update old ones. Over the years I have played with many forms of code including html, xhtml, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MooTools, SQL, Java, Python, Ruby, Laravel, and more. You can check out my [Treehouse account](https://teamtreehouse.com/atrianwagner) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atrianwagner) for more info on my development experience. Additionally I love writing technical documentation.

I enjoy tackling new problems and figuring out how everything works. Problems are puzzles that have yet to be matched to their solutions. <3
