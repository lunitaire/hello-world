# hello-world

My online alias is lunitaire. My analog handle is Atrian.

I have been going by lunitaire since the days of Geocities. In recent years others have started using this username as well. You can generally tell if a profile belongs to me if it references my first name, Atrian, or is linked by another account of mine, like [Keybase.](https://keybase.io/atrian)

My interests are diverse thanks to my love of learning and sense of curiosity. I have pivoted across many roles throughout the tech and design industries. I thoroughly enjoy designing and developing new projects and finding innovative ways to support and update old ones.

In the past Github was not an effective tool for giving a clear view of my development experience since many of my previous employers opted to not use Github and to have my work be under NDA. You can check out more details on my previous work experience at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atrianwagner).

I enjoy tackling new problems and figuring out how everything works. Problems are puzzles that have yet to be matched to their solutions. <3
