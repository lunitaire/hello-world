# hello-world

My online alias is lunitaire. My analog handle is Atrian. 

I have been going by lunitaire since the days of Geocities, but much to my dismay in recent years others have started using this username as well. You can generally tell if a profile belongs to me if it references my name, Atrian, or is linked by another account of mine, like [Keybase.](https://keybase.io/atrian)

I have many talents and interests thanks to my love of learning and sense of curiosity. I have pivoted across many roles throughout the tech and design industries. I thoroughly enjoy designing and developing new projects and finding innovative ways to support and update old ones. Over the years I have played with many forms of code including html, xhtml, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MooTools, SQL, Java, Python, Ruby, Laravel, and more. You can check out my [Treehouse account](https://teamtreehouse.com/atrianwagner) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atrianwagner) for more info on my development experience. Additionally I love writing technical documentation.

I enjoy tackling new problems and figuring out how everything works. Problems are puzzles that have yet to be matched to their solutions. <3
