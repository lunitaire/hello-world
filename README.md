# hello-world

My online alias is lunitaire. Some of you may know me by my analog handle: Atrian. 

I have been going by lunitaire since the days of Geocities, but lately others have started using and claiming this username across the web. To differentiate myself from others I have started rebranding myself across the web as **Atrian \\\\lunitaire**. 

I am an individual of many talents and interests. I blame this on my love of learning and my sense of curiosity. I have worked as a Graphic Designer, 3D modeler, Helpdesk Technician, NetAdmin, Project and Technical Manager, a Software Engineer, and currently as an Application Support Engineer. I thoroughly enjoy designing and developing new projects and finding innovative ways to support and update old ones. Over the years I have played with many forms of code including html, xhtml, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MooTools, SQL, Java, Python, Ruby, Laravel, and more. You can check out my [Treehouse account](https://teamtreehouse.com/atrianwagner) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atrianwagner) for more info on my development experience. Lately I've been loving writing technical documentation.

I enjoy tackling new problems and figuring out how everything works. It is a shame that my work projects cannot be on Github.
