# hello-world

My online alias is lunitaire. Some of you may know me by my analog handle: Atrian. I have been going by lunitaire since the days of Geocities, but lately others have started using and claiming this username across the web. At times I have had to go with lunitair3 as an alternate. To differentiate myself from others I have started rebranding myself across the web as **Atrian \\\\lunitaire**. When checking out anyone across the web using the alias lunitaire, check for Atrian or Atrian \\\\lunitaire to ensure it's me that you've found.

I am an individual of many talents and interests. I blame this on my love of learning and my sense of curiosity. I have worked as a Graphic Designer, 3D modeler, Helpdesk Technician, NetAdmin, Project and Technical Manager, and currently as a Software Engineer. I thoroughly enjoy designing and developing new projects and finding innovative ways to support and update old ones. Over the years I have played with many forms of code including html, xhtml, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, MooTools, SQL, Java, Python, Ruby, Laravel, and more. You can check out my [Treehouse account](https://teamtreehouse.com/atrianwagner) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atrianwagner) for more info on my software development experience.

I enjoy tackling new problems and figuring out how everything works. Github is an interesting place, and I have spent much time lurking. I look forward to contributing and playing with code.
