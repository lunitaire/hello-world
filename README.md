# hello-world

My online alias is lunitaire. Some of you may know me by my analog handle as Atrian. I have been going by lunitaire since the days of Geocities, but lately others have started using and claiming this username across the web. At times I have had to go with lunitair3 as an alternate. To differentiate myself from others I have started rebranding myself across the web as "Atrian \\\\lunitaire". When checking out anyone across the web using the alias lunitaire, check for Atrian or Atrian \\\\lunitaire to ensure it's me that you've found.

I am an individual of many talents and interests. I blame this on my love of learning and my sense of curiosity. I have worked as a Graphic Designer, 3D modeler, Helpdesk Technician, NetAdmin, Project and Technical Manager, and currently as a Software Engineer. I am most excited about my current and newest role. Over the years I have played with many forms of code including html, xhtml, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, MooTools, SQL, Java, Python, Laravel, and more. You can check out my Treehouse account at https://teamtreehouse.com/atrianwagner or my LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/atrianwagner for more info on my software development experience.

I enjoy tackling new problems and figuring out how everything works. Github is an interesting place, and I have spent much time lurking. I look forward to contributing and playing with code.
